-TDD driven development
-Acceptance tests before unit tests if unit tests does not exist
-Proposed your changes to the users before implementing
-Propose small changes, user context is small
-Do not generate code until approach is decided
-When generating code one snipped at a time
-Always generate code comments, dont assume familiarity with the library or language idioms
-Update documentation as needed for each change
