## Status
Draft

## Abstract
This RFC proposes a multi-agent system for Agent Zero that enables the creation, management, and interaction between multiple AI agents. Each agent maintains its own context, memory, and knowledge base while being able to collaborate with other agents.

## Background and Motivation
Currently, Agent Zero operates as a single agent system. However, complex tasks often benefit from having multiple specialized agents working together. A multi-agent system would allow:
1. Task specialization
2. Parallel processing
3. Redundancy and fault tolerance
4. Different personality traits and expertise areas
5. Better organization of knowledge and context

## Design Overview

### 1. Agent Management
- **AgentManager**: Central component for creating, deleting, and switching between agents
- **Agent Directory Structure**:
```
work_dir/
└── agents/
    ├── zero/          # Default agent
    │   ├── memory/
    │   └── knowledge/
    └── agent_name/    # Custom agents
        ├── memory/
        └── knowledge/
```

### 2. Core Components

#### 2.1 Agent Configuration
```python
@dataclass
class AgentConfig:
    agent_current_name: str  # Unique identifier for the agent
    chat_model: ModelConfig
    utility_model: ModelConfig
    embeddings_model: ModelConfig
    memory_subdir: str
    knowledge_subdirs: list[str]
    # ... other configuration options
```

#### 2.2 Agent Context
```python
class AgentContext:
    def __init__(self, config: AgentConfig, id: str = None, name: str = None):
        self.id = id or str(uuid.uuid4())
        self.name = name
        self.config = config
        self.agent0 = Agent(0, config, self)  # Primary agent instance
```

### 3. Key Features

#### 3.1 Agent Creation and Initialization
- Support for creating new agents with custom configurations
- Automatic directory structure setup for memory and knowledge
- Initialization of required models and resources

#### 3.2 Agent Protection
- Special protection for the "zero" agent (cannot be deleted)
- Validation of agent operations to prevent data corruption

#### 3.3 Inter-Agent Communication
- Message passing between agents
- Shared knowledge base access
- Context switching with state preservation

#### 3.4 Memory and Knowledge Management
- Isolated memory spaces per agent
- Shared knowledge bases when needed
- Efficient context switching without memory leaks

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Implement AgentManager class with basic CRUD operations
2. Set up directory structure and file management
3. Add agent configuration validation
4. Implement agent protection mechanisms

### Phase 2: Agent Interaction
1. Add message passing system between agents
2. Implement context switching
3. Add shared knowledge base access
4. Create agent collaboration protocols

### Phase 3: UI/UX Integration
1. Add CLI commands for agent management
2. Integrate with web UI
3. Add agent status visualization
4. Implement agent switching UI

## Security Considerations
1. Isolation between agent memory spaces
2. Access control for shared resources
3. Protection against unauthorized agent deletion
4. Secure message passing between agents

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for agent interactions
3. Acceptance tests for end-to-end workflows
4. Performance tests for multi-agent scenarios

### Test Cases
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_smoke_cli_interaction():
    """Test basic CLI interaction with agents"""
    pass

async def test_zero_agent_protection():
    """Ensure zero agent cannot be deleted"""
    pass

async def test_agent_creation():
    """Test creating new agents with custom configs"""
    pass

async def test_agent_switching():
    """Test switching between agents"""
    pass
```

## Migration Strategy
1. Maintain backward compatibility with single-agent mode
2. Provide migration tools for existing agent data
3. Update documentation with multi-agent examples
4. Add feature flags for gradual rollout

## Open Questions
1. How to handle resource allocation between multiple agents?
2. What is the optimal strategy for shared knowledge access?
3. How to manage model loading with multiple agents?
4. What are the memory implications of multiple active agents?

## Success Metrics
1. Successful creation and management of multiple agents
2. Effective collaboration between agents
3. Minimal performance impact from multi-agent operations
4. User adoption of multi-agent features

```python
config = AgentConfig(
    agent_current_name="research_agent",
    chat_model=ModelConfig(...),

    memory_subdir="memory",
    knowledge_subdirs=["knowledge"]
)
```
