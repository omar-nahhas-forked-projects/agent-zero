## Design Principles

The tech stack is designed with the following principles in mind:

1. **Modularity**: Each component can be updated or replaced independently
2. **Scalability**: Supports multiple model providers and processing capabilities
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features and integrations
4. **Developer-Friendly**: Comprehensive development environment setup
5. **Production-Ready**: Includes containerization and security features

## Version Management

Dependencies are managed through `requirements.txt` for Python packages and `package.json` for Node.js dependencies. Regular updates are recommended to maintain security and compatibility.
